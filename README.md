my second project with authentication feature 
This site enables you to login and add products . It is some sort of shopping website from where you can shop (but not really) . I developed it just to practice authentication and media 
files . You can login and add products . But it was developed to soon so it has some bugs like it doesn't check if user is anonymous or not.
TO RUN THE FILE IN YOUR LOCAL SERVER , RUN :{ python manage.py runserver  } COMMAND IN YOUR TERMINAL .
